**Storage:** EventTable with OwnerType=0, OwnerID=PersonID

**Examples:**

- Occupation, Education
- Census, Residence
- SSN, DNA test

**Count:** 52 built-in types

---

---

## Field Usage Patterns

### V/D/P Notation

The "V/D/P" notation indicates which fields are used:
- **V** (UseValue): Description/Value field (0=not used, 1=used)
- **D** (UseDate): Date field (0=not used, 1=used)
- **P** (UsePlace): Place field (0=not used, 1=used)

### Common Patterns

**Pattern: 0/1/1** (Most common)
- Date and place, no description
- Examples: Birth, Baptism, Marriage, Burial
- Clean events with date/place only

**Pattern: 1/1/1**
- Date, place, AND description
- Examples: Death (cause), Occupation (job), Property (value)
- Rich events with additional detail

**Pattern: 1/0/0**
- Value only, no date/place
- Examples: SSN, AFN, Ref#
- Identifiers and reference numbers

**Pattern: 0/1/0**
- Date only (rare)
- Examples: DNA test
- Time-stamped but not location-specific

## Querying Fact Types

### Get All Events for a Person

```sql
SELECT
    ft.Name as FactType,
    e.Date,
    e.Details,
    p.Name as Place
FROM EventTable e
JOIN FactTypeTable ft ON e.EventType = ft.FactTypeID
LEFT JOIN PlaceTable p ON e.PlaceID = p.PlaceID
WHERE e.OwnerType = 0  -- Person
  AND e.OwnerID = ?     -- PersonID
ORDER BY e.SortDate;
```

### Get All Family Events

```sql
SELECT
    ft.Name as FactType,
    e.Date,
    f.FatherID,
    f.MotherID
FROM EventTable e
JOIN FactTypeTable ft ON e.EventType = ft.FactTypeID
JOIN FamilyTable f ON e.OwnerID = f.FamilyID
WHERE e.OwnerType = 1  -- Family
  AND e.OwnerID = ?     -- FamilyID
ORDER BY e.SortDate;
```

### Get Vital Events Only

```sql
SELECT
    p.PersonID,
    n.Surname,
    n.Given,
    ft.Name,
    e.Date
FROM PersonTable p
JOIN NameTable n ON p.PersonID = n.OwnerID AND n.IsPrimary = 1
JOIN EventTable e ON p.PersonID = e.OwnerID
JOIN FactTypeTable ft ON e.EventType = ft.FactTypeID
WHERE e.EventType IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  -- Birth, Death, Christen, Burial, Cremation
ORDER BY p.PersonID, e.SortDate;
```

### Count Events by Type

```sql
SELECT
    ft.FactTypeID,
    ft.Name,
    COUNT(*) as EventCount
FROM EventTable e
JOIN FactTypeTable ft ON e.EventType = ft.FactTypeID
GROUP BY ft.FactTypeID, ft.Name
ORDER BY EventCount DESC;
```

## Notes for AI Agents

1. **FactTypeID < 1000** = built-in types, **>= 1000** = custom user types

2. **OwnerType determines table join:**
   - 0 = Person → JOIN PersonTable
   - 1 = Family → JOIN FamilyTable

3. **UseValue/UseDate/UsePlace flags** indicate which fields are meaningful

4. **GEDCOM tag "EVEN"** is generic - check FactType name for specifics

5. **Vital events (1, 2, 300)** should be prioritized in biographies

6. **Family events** require both spouses for complete narrative

7. **LDS ordinances** (31-33, 38-39, 309) are religion-specific

8. **Identifiers** (30, 34, 35) have no dates - don't expect Date field

9. **Custom types vary by database** - query FactTypeTable for each database

10. **Sentence templates** (FactTypeTable.Sentence) define narrative generation
